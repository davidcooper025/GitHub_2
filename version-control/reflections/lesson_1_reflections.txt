How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Easy to see old data

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    help to get to old code

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    programmer is in command of the version control

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    multiple file commit in one go help us to know how many  files we changed for some code change

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log help us to view commits and git diff help us to see diff. b/w two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If the code breaks then we can take old stable file

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For my practise project
